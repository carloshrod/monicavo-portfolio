					Hello! I am Móni, a passionate photographer born in Bogotá, Colombia.
					Over the past six years, I have lived out one of my greatest passions:
					traveling the world. My adventures led me to capture unique moments
					and breathtaking landscapes as an amateur, which ignited a deep love
					for photography in me and motivated me to turn professional. Two years
					ago, I decided to focus my career on portrait photography, exploring
					both studio work and outdoor shoots. While I enjoy the precision and
					control of studio work, my true passion lies in outdoor photography,
					where nature and natural light play a crucial role in creating unique
					and authentic images.
				</p>
				<p class='mb-4'>
					Currently, I am specializing in artistic portraiture, always striving
					to capture the essence and personality of each person who stands
					before my camera. Additionally, I have expanded my knowledge in
					fashion photography, allowing me to blend the art of portraiture with
					elegance and style. Every photograph is an opportunity to tell a
					story, and my goal is to make each session a memorable and enriching
					experience for my clients.
				</p>
				<p class='mb-4'>
					If you would like me to work on your photography project, feel free to
					contact me.
